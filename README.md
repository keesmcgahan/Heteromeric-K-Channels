# Heteromeric-K-Channels
A repository containing the Matlab code used to generate figures and analysis for a kinetic heteromeric voltage gated potassium channel model.

There are two matlab codes:
1) power4func: is a matlab function that performs the analysis to make the argument that potassium channels modeled with HH format should use more than 1 gate. This function reuires additional downlaoding from the online database ChannelPedia.com (https://channelpedia.epfl.ch/).
