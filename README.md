# Heteromeric-K-Channels
A repository containing the Matlab code used to generate figures and analysis for a kinetic heteromeric voltage gated potassium channel model.

There are two matlab codes:
1) power4func.m: is a matlab function that performs the analysis to make the argument that potassium channels modeled with HH format should use more than 1 gate. This function reuires additional downlaoding from the online database ChannelPedia.com (https://channelpedia.epfl.ch/). 

2)Allhetexps.m is matlab code that generates heteromeric model outputs for all the figures presented in the heteromeric-K channel paper. It also generates the analysis of the different voltages at which specified probabilites are attained. 

Descriptions of which variables and things to change are given throughout labeled code.
